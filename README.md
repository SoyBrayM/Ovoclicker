# Ovoclicker
This is a basic Terminal version built for my PDOO (Stands for Object Oriented Programing and Design in spanish) course, taken in 2nd semester of 2023.

Just a little silly homework, nothing serious.
For a better implementation of the concept, click [here](soybraym.github.io/OvoClickerJS) or check the similar named repository in my profile.
